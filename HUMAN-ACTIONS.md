## #100 🔴 [BLOCKING] iOS-1: test the new app on iPhone + iPad (~40 min)
<!-- ha filed=2026-10-04 -->

**Why:** One UI's iOS-1 gate. All new screens (Waves 1–4) shipped by OTA on TestFlight build 38; nothing more is built on iOS until iPhone and iPad are checked.

**Steps:**
1. iPhone (coordinate with the iPhone tester) and your iPad: open TestFlight → Long Live → Install/Update.
2. Follow docs/plans/one-ui/device-checklists.md → "iOS-1": iPhone 7 steps, iPad 8 steps.
3. Never type numbers — tap Send report and run Speed test mode; reports reach issue #4791.
4. Reply one line per device, e.g. `iPhone: pass 1-6, fail 7: <what you saw>`.

**Worked if:** both devices reply all-pass, or each failure names what was on screen.

## #99 🟢 [UPGRADE] Send two app IDs so longlivets.com links open the app (~5 min)
<!-- ha filed=2026-10-04 -->

**Why:** One UI H6 (universal links) needs the Apple Team ID and the Play app-signing SHA-256 in the link files. Not needed until Wave 3; nothing is blocked yet.

**Steps:**
1. Open https://developer.apple.com/account → Membership details → copy the 10-character Team ID.
2. Open https://play.google.com/console → Long Live → Test and release → App integrity → Play app signing → Settings.
3. Under "App signing key certificate", copy the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint.
4. Paste both into the Claude chat (copy-paste, no typing). They are public identifiers, not secrets.

**Worked if:** both values appear in docs/one-ui/drafts/well-known/ in place of the placeholders.
